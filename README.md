### Folder Structure

    This is the Android project.

- electron

    This is the Electron project.

- public

    This is the folder containing global resources for Vue.

- src

    This is the main folder for Vue developing. It's the main thing in this project.

    This is the folder which Vue exports to. It's not included because it's generated.

    _**NOTES:**_

    _Please note that we modified `@capacitor/android` for notification issues._

    _**So you may need to copy `src/assets/notificationIcon.png` to `node_modules\@capacitor\android\capacitor\src\main\res\drawable` and rename it into `ic_stat_name.png` and then delete `notificationManager.createNotificationChannel(channel);` in `LocalNotificationManager.java` the time you set up wnr and every time you update capacitor.**_
